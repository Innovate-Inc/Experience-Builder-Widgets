Experience Builder Widgets

## Add Data
The Add Data Widget is available for deployment in next generation web apps, leveraging ArcGIS Experience Builder's powerful and versatile React-based framework to allow end users to search for, add, and remove data sources to maps.

Multiple configuration options will allow you to connect to a variety of data sources and enable users to search by category, group, and more. A responsive user interface will display key information about each data layer fully without opening a new tab or leaving the experience.

This tool will enable a dynamic web experience with access to relevant data without overwhelming users with a long layer list or conflicting symbology. With the layer details included in the widget, users of all skill levels can quickly research and select data sources even if they are unfamiliar.
