# Add Data Widget

The Add Data Widget adds functionality for users to search for, add, and remove data sources to maps.

This fully configurable tool offers connections to a variety of data sources and enables users to search by item type, portal group, and more. Functionality from the Web App Builder standard Add Data widget is reproduced, with added tools to view important item details without leaving the app and a clean interface mirroring the portal gallery.
